# 📓 My Bioinformatics Notebook

Hi! I’m Cynthia, a bioinformatics scientist specializing in single-cell, multiome, and spatial transcriptomics analyses. This notebook is my way of documenting workflows, small discoveries, troubleshooting notes, and general insights I pick up along the way. It’s meant to be both a personal reference and an open resource for anyone working on similar problems.

## 🚀 What you’ll find here

- **Practical workflows** for scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, multiome, and Visium spatial data using tools like Seurat, Signac, MACS2, and more.
- **Step-by-step notes:** including code snippets, typical parameter settings, and how I debug common issues.
- **Short technical write-ups** on topics like peak-to-gene linkage, clustering strategies, and cis-regulatory element analysis.
- **Visual checks:** quick ggplots, dendrograms, UMAPs, and coverage plots that help sanity-check results.

## 🔍 Why share this?

Behind every polished figure or published method is a messy process of trial, error, and hard-earned lessons. I’m sharing these notes to:

- Provide evidence of the knowledge and experience that goes into this work.
- Help others avoid the same pitfalls (or at least feel less alone in them).
- Build a transparent portfolio of how I approach data analysis, from first QC plots to final interpretation.
