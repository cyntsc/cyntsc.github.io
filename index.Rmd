## Bio

I love working at the intersection of biology and data science, I actively look for new strategies to handle multiomic data. My current interest are in analize transcriptomic and epigenomic data sequenced with cellranger-ARC sequencing, now I am working with human brain tissue, and other public datasets from human and mouse tissue. My implementations are standing in improve known pipelines based on R packages code, like Seurat and Signac, but eventually I will be testing multiomic software based on python.\
I have previous experience working with bulk RNA-seq datasets from plants tissue, I have also some experience with unsupervised machine learning (ML) methods with keras & tensorflow for python in GoogleCollab.

I am aware of the prevailing need to convey the relevance and opportunity presented by emerging areas in data science and modern biology, so I am very excited to actively participate in the future of human health and food safety that the future holds for us.
